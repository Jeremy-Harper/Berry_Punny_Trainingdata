# Berry_Punny_Trainingdata

## Python code to build your own training data to replicate openai "Strawberry" with finetuning etc
### This is a Synthetic Dataset Generator with Chain-of-Thought Grading

This repository provides a Python tool for synthetic dataset generation with built-in grading for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. The primary goal of this project is to create a fast, scalable solution for generating high-quality custom datasets used for finetuning and training language models, particularly focusing on reasoning and logic-based queries. The dataset generation aims to replicate the complexity and depth of OpenAI's "Strawberry" reasoning capabilities by using structured CoT evaluation and grading mechanisms.

## Features
Custom Dataset Generation: The tool generates synthetic data for a wide variety of domains and task areas, with reasoning-intensive questions.
Chain-of-Thought Grading: Each generated response is evaluated based on a detailed CoT reasoning rubric, ensuring that only high-quality data is added to the dataset.
Automated Evaluation and Quality Control: Responses are graded across several key criteria, including logical coherence, depth of reasoning, factual correctness, and clarity.
Flexible Domain and Task Support: Iterates over a JSON-based input file of domains and tasks to generate domain-specific questions and responses.
Scalable: Efficient handling of multiple API calls with rate-limiting controls for large-scale dataset generation.
Use Case
The primary use case of this project is for organizations or individuals looking to fine-tune and train large language models (LLMs) with high-quality, reasoning-intensive datasets, with minimal manual intervention. This is especially valuable when aiming to replicate the capabilities of advanced models like OpenAI's Strawberry.

## Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
openai Python library for interfacing with local or cloud-based large language models.
Install Required Libraries
First, clone the repository and install the required libraries.

## bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/strawberry-synthetic-dataset.git
cd strawberry-synthetic-dataset
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure that you configure the OpenAI API correctly in the client object. This can either be a local LLM server or OpenAI's API service.

## Example:
json
Copy code
[
    {
        "domain": "Medicine and Healthcare",
        "task_area": "Medical diagnosis"
    },
    {
        "domain": "Software Development",
        "task_area": "Refactoring legacy code"
    }
]
API Configuration: Add your API key to the code, or configure it to point to your local LLM endpoint:

##python

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",  # Replace with your API key its setup to work with lmstudio out of the box
    base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1",  # Replace with your local LLM server URL if applicable
)

## Usage
The tool takes a JSON file (domains_and_tasks.json) as input and performs the following steps for each domain and task:

Novel Question Generation: A novel, reasoning-intensive question is generated for the given domain and task.
Response Generation: A response to the question is generated by querying an LLM.
Chain-of-Thought Grading: The response is evaluated based on logical coherence, reasoning depth, factual correctness, and clarity.
Quality Check: If the response meets the quality standards (no criterion below 6, overall score above 8), it is saved in JSON format.


## Running the Code
bash
Copy code
python getexamples.py
This will iterate over the provided domains_and_tasks.json file and generate the synthetic questions and responses. Responses that pass the grading process will be saved in questions_and_responses.json.

Output
The final output will be a JSON file containing the generated questions and high-quality responses in the following format:

json
Copy code
[
    {
        "prompt": "What are the key symptoms that differentiate pneumonia from bronchitis?",
        "response": "Pneumonia typically presents with fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing, while bronchitis is characterized by coughing and mucus production. Pneumonia also has more severe symptoms..."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "How can legacy code be refactored for improved efficiency in software development?",
        "response": "Refactoring legacy code involves identifying inefficient algorithms, removing redundant code blocks, and leveraging modern language features like asynchronous functions to optimize performance..."
    }
]
## Training Methods for Fine-tuning LLMs
To replicate the reasoning and inference capabilities of OpenAI's Strawberry, the following training methods can be applied using the synthetic datasets generated by this tool:

Supervised Fine-tuning: Train the model using a labeled dataset where both the question and the high-quality, graded response are provided.
Chain-of-Thought Training: Focus on training the model to handle CoT tasks, specifically by structuring the training data in a way that encourages multi-step reasoning.
Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF): Incorporate human feedback into the training process by fine-tuning the model to prefer outputs that are graded highly by human evaluators.
Self-Critique and Self-Improvement: Fine-tune the model by encouraging it to generate its own reasoning paths, self-evaluate its performance, and correct itself.
Knowledge Distillation: Use a large, high-performing model (like OpenAI's GPT-4) as a teacher to train smaller models on this synthetic dataset.
Unsupervised Pre-training: For large-scale pre-training, use the synthetic dataset to continue training an LLM on reasoning-based tasks without explicit supervision.
Curriculum Learning: Train the model by gradually increasing the difficulty of reasoning tasks, starting with simpler questions and progressing to more complex multi-step reasoning problems.
Grading Appliance: Chain-of-Thought Evaluation
The built-in Chain-of-Thought grading module ensures that only high-quality responses are included in the final dataset. Each response is evaluated on:

Logical Coherence: Are the reasoning steps logical and follow from the question?
Depth of Reasoning: Does the response explore multiple aspects of the problem?
Correctness: Is the response factually accurate?
Clarity: Is the response clear and easy to understand?
If the response fails any of these criteria, it is rejected, ensuring that the dataset only contains high-quality, reasoning-intensive examples.
